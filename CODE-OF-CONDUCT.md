# Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of the August-GPT open source project, we pledge to create a welcoming, safe, and inclusive community that fosters collaboration and innovation. We value diversity and embrace differences in age, culture, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, language, physical and mental abilities, race, religion, sexual orientation, and socio-economic status.

By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct, which sets forth expectations for our behavior within the project community. Violations of this Code of Conduct may result in temporary or permanent bans from the project.

## Our Standards

We expect all contributors, maintainers, and participants in the August-GPT project community to:

-   Be respectful and considerate in all communications and interactions with others, regardless of their background or identity.
-   Refrain from engaging in any form of harassment, including but not limited to sexual harassment, trolling, personal attacks, or threatening behavior.
-   Refrain from making derogatory or discriminatory comments or jokes that are inappropriate or unwelcome.
-   Listen actively and be open to constructive feedback and criticism, as well as providing it in a respectful manner.
-   Be patient, as not everyone will have the same level of knowledge or experience.
-   Refrain from promoting products or services in discussions or interactions that are unrelated to the project.
-   Respect the privacy and confidentiality of others, and only disclose personal information with explicit and informed consent.
-   Make an effort to be inclusive and welcoming to all, and to use language and actions that reflect this.

## Enforcing this Code of Conduct

If you observe any instances of abusive, harassing or otherwise unacceptable behavior, please report it immediately to the project maintainer, Zack Langford, at [zack@cloudzack.com](mailto:zack@cloudzack.com) and provide as much detail as possible.

We promise to review every issue report and to take appropriate action, which may include escalation to leadership, temporary or permanent ban from the project, or other appropriate measures.

We ask that all members of the community respect the Code of Conduct and help us maintain an environment that is safe, welcoming, and respectful to all.
