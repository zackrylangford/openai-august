# August-GPT

This is a simple application that allows the user to prompt the gpt-3.5-turbo model from openai in a chat format. Currently, the application runs in the terminal and records the conversation in at .txt format for later review.

August can walk you through the creation of a blog post with prompts and help edit and format a blog post with the command --coach. 

There is also a script to have August write a full blog post about a topic that is entered by the user. Simply input --blog and August will walk the user through a blog post creation program and output the blog post into a .txt file in a specified directory in the settings. 

- ðŸ‘† make sure to update the settings to reflect your username as well as create a new username for your AI. You can also specify the directory that you would like to save chat and blog post output. 

- ðŸ‘‹ August is programmed with a couple of commands to use take advantage of the gpt model. See the list of commands here [COMMANDS](COMMANDS.md)

- ðŸ¤– I named the AI "August" so it felt a little more personal.
